# 1. Question: What will be the result of applying the addition operator between two numbers?
a = 5
b = 10
result = a + b
print("Result of addition:", result)  # Output: Result of addition: 15
# Logic: The + operator adds the values of a and b.

# 2. Question: How does the subtraction operator work between two numbers?
a = 15
b = 7
result = a - b
print("Result of subtraction:", result)  # Output: Result of subtraction: 8
# Logic: The - operator subtracts b from a.

# 3. Question: What happens when the multiplication operator is used between two numbers?
a = 4
b = 3
result = a * b
print("Result of multiplication:", result)  # Output: Result of multiplication: 12
# Logic: The * operator multiplies a and b.

# 4. Question: How does the division operator behave with floating-point numbers?
a = 15
b = 4
result = a / b
print("Result of division:", result)  # Output: Result of division: 3.75
# Logic: The / operator divides a by b and returns a floating-point result.

# 5. Question: What is the result of using the floor division operator?
a = 15
b = 4
result = a // b
print("Result of floor division:", result)  # Output: Result of floor division: 3
# Logic: The // operator performs integer division, discarding the remainder.

# 6. Question: How does the modulus operator work?
a = 15
b = 4
result = a % b
print("Result of modulus:", result)  # Output: Result of modulus: 3
# Logic: The % operator returns the remainder after dividing a by b.

# 7. Question: How does the exponentiation operator function?
a = 2
b = 3
result = a ** b
print("Result of exponentiation:", result)  # Output: Result of exponentiation: 8
# Logic: The ** operator raises a to the power of b.

# 8. Question: What will be the result of comparison using the equal-to operator?
a = 5
b = 5
result = (a == b)
print("Is a equal to b?", result)  # Output: Is a equal to b? True
# Logic: The == operator checks if a is equal to b.

# 9. Question: What happens with the not equal-to operator?
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a != b)
print("Is a not equal to b?", result)  # Output: Is a not equal to b? True
# Logic: The != operator checks if a is not equal to b.

# 10. Question: How does the greater-than operator work?
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a > b)
print("Is a greater than b?", result)  # Output: Is a greater than b? True
# Logic: The > operator checks if a is greater than b.

# 11. Question: How does the less-than operator work?
a = 2
b = 3
result = (a < b)
print("Is a less than b?", result)  # Output: Is a less than b? True
# Logic: The < operator checks if a is less than b.

# 12. Question: What is the result of using the logical AND operator?
a = True
b = False
result = (a and b)
print("Result of logical AND:", result)  # Output: Result of logical AND: False
# Logic: The `and` operator returns True only if both conditions are True.

# 13. Question: What will happen if the logical OR operator is used?
a = True
b = False
result = (a or b)
print("Result of logical OR:", result)  # Output: Result of logical OR: True
# Logic: The `or` operator returns True if at least one condition is True.

# 14. Question: How does the logical NOT operator work?
a = True
result = not a
print("Result of logical NOT:", result)  # Output: Result of logical NOT: False
# Logic: The `not` operator inverts the value of a.

# 15. Question: What is the result of bitwise AND operation?
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary
result = a & b
print("Result of bitwise AND:", result)  # Output: Result of bitwise AND: 1
# Logic: The & operator performs bitwise AND on a and b.

# 16. Question: What will be the result of bitwise OR operation?
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary
result = a | b
print("Result of bitwise OR:", result)  # Output: Result of bitwise OR: 7
# Logic: The | operator performs bitwise OR on a and b.

# 17. Question: What happens when you use the left shift operator?
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
result = a << 1
print("Result of left shift:", result)  # Output: Result of left shift: 10
# Logic: The << operator shifts the bits of a to the left by 1 position.

# 18. Question: How does the right shift operator work?
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
result = a >> 1
print("Result of right shift:", result)  # Output: Result of right shift: 2
# Logic: The >> operator shifts the bits of a to the right by 1 position.

# 19. Question: What is the effect of the identity operator `is`?
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
result = (a is b)
print("Do a and b point to the same object?", result)  # Output: Do a and b point to the same object? True
# Logic: The `is` operator checks if two objects are the same in memory.

# 20. Question: How does the membership operator `in` work?
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 3 in a
print("Is 3 in the list?", result)  # Output: Is 3 in the list? True
# Logic: The `in` operator checks if a value exists in a sequence like a list.
